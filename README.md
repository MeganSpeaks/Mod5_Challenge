# PyBer Analysis

## Overview
I created a summary of ride-sharing data by city type.  Then I created a multiple-line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type from January through April 2019.  The goal is to find differences in ride-sharing data by city type to help the decision-makers at PyBer.
